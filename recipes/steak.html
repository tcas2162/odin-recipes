    <p>This grilled steak is delicious and will leave all of your family and friends craving second and third helpings. This recipe has been lifted from the allrecipes.com Bourbon Street New York Strip Steak recipe with a few of my own homemade touches.</p>
    <p>Feel free to add additional seasoning and steak sauce of your choice. I personally prefer a heavy sprinkling of Target's Good and Gather Lemon Pepper and/or Steak seasoning, along with Primal Kitchen's Steak Sauce. My dad always preferred Peter Luger's Steak Sauce and I will sometimes use that instead as a tribute to him.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>2 (6 ounce) boneless New York strip steaks</li>
          <li>3 cups bourbon whiskey</li>
          <li>1 cup dark brown sugar</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>Gently tenderize steaks with meat mallet. Lightly score the meat on one side diagonally. Place steaks in casserole dish with scored side up, then pour bourbon over them. Rub brown sugar evenly over each steak. Marinate in refrigerator for 1 to 3 hours.</li>
          <li>Preheat grill to high heat. Lightly oil grate.</li>
          <li>Place steaks on the hot grill with the sugar side down. Let cook until sugar has caramelized, 3 to 5 minutes, then flip steaks and cook to preferred level.</li>
      </ol>
