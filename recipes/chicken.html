  <p>This is one of my favorite go-to's on the grill, along with Steak and Salmon. Personally, I like to add a heavy sprinkling of Target's Good and Gather Lemon Pepper seasoning for added flavor as well.</p>
  <p>Allow for approximately 10 minutes of prep time, 20 minutes of cook time and be sure to prepare the marinade beforehand. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate anywhere from 8 hours to overnight.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
        <li>3 1/2 teaspoons poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 chicken thighs</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk vinegar, oil, eggs, salt, poultry seasoning and black pepper together in a large bowl until marinade is well mixed; add chicken. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat outdoor grill for medium high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from marinade, reserving the marinade. Place on grill. Grill chicken, flipping and basting chicken with remaining marinade, until chickn is no longer pink in the center, 10 to 15 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer should be inserted near the bone to test and should read no less than 165 degrees F/74 degrees C</li>
    </ol>
